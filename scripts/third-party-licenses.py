"""Writes src-tauri/resources/licenses/third-party-licenses.txt: the
license texts of everything Floppy's own program ships, as the licenses
ask (BSD and MIT: "the above copyright notice and this permission notice
shall be included"). tauri.conf.json bundles resources/licenses/ into the
app's resources, which About's Show Licenses reveals. The same script as
the other ansiapps apps' (2026-10-03).

What's included, for one target (the host's, or the one given):
- every Rust crate the app links: normal dependencies, followed from
  Floppy's own crate (not build tools or dev dependencies, which don't
  ship), each with the license files in its folder;
- the C libraries a crate builds in, whose own license files sit deeper
  in that crate (none today: BUNDLED_C is empty);
- every npm production package, from node_modules;
- the VGA font's license (CC BY-SA 4.0), shipped beside the font too.
It also copies the repo's LICENSE (GPL v2) beside it as GPL-2.0.txt: Floppy's
own license and that of the bundled emulators (DOSBox Staging, FS-UAE,
Basilisk II), separate programs whose source is offered with every
release (scripts/fetch-sources.sh). FS-UAE and Basilisk II carry no
license file of their own.

Identical texts are written once, with every package that uses them.
Some crates leave their license file out of the package they publish.
For those, a sibling crate's file by the same authors (NO_FILE), else
the standard text of the license they declare (scripts/licenses/,
choosing MIT, then BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0 from an OR) with
their listed authors as the copyright holders, and the entry says so.
A crate whose license has no template fails the script.

build-release.sh runs this before every release build, so each platform's
packages carry their own target's list. Run it yourself whenever
Cargo.lock or package-lock.json changes, and commit the result.

Usage: scripts/third-party-licenses.py [rust-target]
